# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview

Inheritance is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (called a **child class** or **subclass**) to inherit properties and methods from another class (called a **parent class** or **superclass**). This promotes code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchical structure for related objects.

## Key Concepts

1. **Parent Class (Superclass):**
   The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.

2. **Child Class (Subclass):**
   The class that inherits from the parent class. It can extend or override the properties and methods of the parent class.

3. **`super()` Function:**
   A function used to call the parent class's methods or constructor from the child class.

4. **Method Overriding:**
   The ability of the child class to provide its own version of a method that is already defined in the parent class.

## Example: Inheritance in Python

Below is an example of how inheritance works in Python:

```python
# Parent class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

# Child class inheriting from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} barks"

# Child class inheriting from Animal
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} meows"

# Create instances of child classes
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy barks
print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers meows
In this example:

Dog and Cat are subclasses of the Animal superclass.
Both subclasses override the speak method of the parent class.
Benefits of Inheritance
Code Reusability: Common functionality can be written in the parent class and reused by child classes.
Extensibility: Child classes can extend the functionality of the parent class.
Improved Maintainability: Reduces code duplication, making maintenance easier.
Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance: A child class inherits from a single parent class.
Multiple Inheritance: A child class inherits from more than one parent class.
Multilevel Inheritance: A class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class.
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.
Example: Multiple Inheritance
python
Copy code
class A:
    def method_a(self):
        return "Method from class A"

class B:
    def method_b(self):
        return "Method from class B"

class C(A, B):
    pass

c = C()
print(c.method_a())  # Output: Method from class A
print(c.method_b())  # Output: Method from class B
